# Programming_Universe
This open source project is a compendium of algorithms, structures and patterns used in different programming languages, from the basic to the most advanced level, aiming to be a reference and help for computer science students. Obviously, this is an arduous and very big task, but the project aims to try to attract the attention of developers from the world community to contribute in some way to the project. Little by little, the compendium can become bigger and more instructive to the community. The project also brings articles and books that are reference in the field of technology to guide students in their search for knowledge.
